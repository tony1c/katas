# Katas Folder

Welcome to the Katas folder! This repository contains a series of simple JavaScript katas designed to help you warm up your hands for your daily coding session. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn JavaScript or an experienced developer, these katas are a great way to practice and warm up yourself.

## What are Katas?

Katas are small coding exercises that focus on improving specific skills or techniques. They are often used by programmers to practice algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving in a fun and engaging way. Each kata in this repository is a standalone exercise that you can complete in a short amount of time, making them perfect for quick coding sessions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the katas, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tony1c/katas.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the `katas/src` folder and start working on the katas by opening them in your favorite code editor.

## Structure

The `katas` folder is organized into subfolders, each containing a set of related katas. Inside each subfolder, you will find:

- JavaScript files for each kata
- A description of the kata and their objectives in each JavaScript file
- Test files to help you verify your solutions

## Running Tests

To run the tests for each kata file, you can use Jest by running the following command:

\`\`\`bash
npx jest filename.test.js
\`\`\`

Replace `filename.test.js` with the actual test file name you want to run.
