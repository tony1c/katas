Write a function everyPossibleSum, that accepts one parameter: myNumber.

Given a number, e.g. 1234,
return every possible sum of two digits, e.g. [ 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7 ].

For this example, we calculate:
[ 1 + 2, 1 + 3, 1 + 4, 2 + 3, 2 + 4, 3 + 4 ]

Input: a number.

Output: an array of numbers.
*/

// console.log(everyPossibleSum(1234));
// [ 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7 ] ✅

// console.log(everyPossibleSum(81596));
// [ 9, 13, 17, 14, 6, 10, 7, 14, 11, 15 ] ✅
